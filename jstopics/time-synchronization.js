hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Digital Twin Registration Agent uses an incremental approach when registering devices. I.e. it checks for changes in the provider DB regularly and registers newly produced devices. For this synchronized clocks between the machine that the Digital Twin Registration Agent is executed on and the Machine on which the Provider DB is executing is necessary. While the Digital Twin Registration Agent will smoothly work with small offsets the clocks on the machines shall not be further apart than a few minutes.<\/p>\n\r"
