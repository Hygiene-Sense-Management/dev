The advertisement data structure id advertises which data is included in the payload of the advertisement package. The id refers to the advertisement data structure that is available in the Catalog Service. For BLE centrals discovering advertisement packages this is therefore the instruction how to parse the advertisement packages.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>Advertisement data: The data as defined by the Advertisement data structure id.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><a id=\"connection-establishing\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><\/p>\n\r"
