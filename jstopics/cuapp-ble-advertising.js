hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App acts as BLE central and continuously discovers HsM BLE-networked devices. This includes processing of the data included in the advertising packets and forwarding of this data to the HsM Backend. Therefore the Xibu App collects basic data about HsM BLE-networked devices in its vicinity without building up Bluetooth connections to those devices (full information about BLE-networked devices is gathered by the gateways when <a href=\"cuapp-ble-browsing.html\" class=\"topiclink\">browsing<\/a> the devices).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The content of the latest advertising packets of each device is forwarded to the HsM Backend once every 60s. I.e. even if the app receives multiple advertising packets of a devices within that minute it will only send the data of the latest packet within one minute to the HsM Backend. The data of the other packets is disregarded. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; line-height: 1.44; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.3750rem 0 0.2500rem 0;\"><table style=\"width:43.7500rem; border:none; border-spacing:0; border-collapse:collapse;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.1250rem; border:solid thin #e1e1e1;\"><p class=\"p_Normal\">iOS specific : <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>It is necessary to receive at least one advertising packet before the app can build up a BLE connection to the device.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>When in background the app will only discover devices once, i.e. only the first advertising packed of a newly detected device will be processed, all other advertising packets of the device will be disregarded.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App considers BLE-networked devices devices as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nearby<\/span> if the latest advertisement package received from that device was received less the last 10 seconds. <\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
