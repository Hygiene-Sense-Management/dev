hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Component placeholders are marked with an visibility attribute. This attribute is a hint to software products showing either the device type\'s component placeholder structure or a device\'s component structure. It allows these software products to show or hide components or component placeholders based on the importance of a component for specific user groups.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Note: The catalog does not provide any authorization model that will ensure that components with are certain visibility are hidden, the visibility attribute is just a hint and must be implemented by clients.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Visibility attributes are comparable, i.e. they can be compared with less, greater or equal operators. Following visibility levels are defined (listed in ascending order):<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Everyone: This placholder or the component variant versions assigne to this placeholder shall be shown to everyone.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Maintenance: This placeholder or the component variant versions assigned to this placeholder shll be whosn only to personnel responsible for the maintenance of devices.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">OEM Customer: This placeholder or the component variant versions assigned to this placehloder shall only be shown to the Oem Customer selling the device.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A component placeholder shall be visible to a user, if the visibility level set for the user is greater or equal to the visibilit set for the placeholder. E.g. If the visibility level for a user is set to Maintenance he shall see all component placeholders with a visibility attribute of everyone or maintenance, but he shall not see component placeholders with a visibiltiy set to OEM Customer.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Modifying visibility attributes<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">When creating a new component placeholder the visibility of that placeholder cannot be less than the visibility of its parent component placeholder. For new level 0 component placehloder any visibility can be set.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">When modifying the visibility an existing component placeholder the new visibility set must not be less than its parent\'s visibility (only checked if the component\'s level &gt; 0) AND the must not be any child component with a visibility level less than the new visibility level set for the component.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Propagation of visibility attribute<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The visibility attribute is set on every component placeholder. A consistent visibility attributeion througout the component placeholder tree structure is guaranteed during modification, therefore no propatation is needed.<\/p>\n\r"
