Each defined resource instance can be mapped to zero, one or more resource instance equivalents, one resource instance equivalent can map to zero or one resource instance within a firmware variant version.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Resource instance equivalents are typed, i.e. a resource instance can only link to resource instance equivalent if the data type of the resource instance is the same as the data type defined for the resource instance equivalent.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A resource instance equivalent has a catalog element description.<\/p>\n\r"
