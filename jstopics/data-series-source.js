This is done by using internally defined metrics to evaluate requests. If the validation fails, the Data Analysis Service will return an error response.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the execution expectation can be met by the Data Analysis Service, it fetches and aggregates data points within the specified time range for each defined data series source. For this, the time bucket and aggregation function specified in the request are used and furthermore any specified offsets are applied in this step. The result of this process is one time series for each data series source with exactly one or none value per time bucket (none if the data series source contains no value within the time buckets time range).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Since those resulting time series might not contain data for every time stamp, the time series analysis can fill up missing data points with the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CarryForward<\/span> option. The overall performance of the analysis service is however affected heavily by this.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the last step the time series analysis aggregates all previously generated time series with the specified device aggregation function. This results in one final time series. In case the device aggregation function is set to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">None <\/span>this last step will be skipped.<\/p>\n\r"
