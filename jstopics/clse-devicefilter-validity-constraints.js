This includes constraints that apply to the structure of the expression tree as well as constraints defined by the individual <a href=\"clse-devicefiltertermtypes.html\" class=\"topiclink\">device filter term types<\/a> used in a device filter.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Hard &amp; soft validity constraints<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Client Service will check some of the validity constraints before each execution of a device filter (<span class=\"f_Term\">hard validity constraints<\/span>) and will break the execution if one of these constraints is violated. Other validity constraints will, by default, not be checked before execution of the device filter (<span class=\"f_Term\">soft validity constraints<\/span>). The result of an execution of a device filter that violates a soft validity constraints will yield results that will probably not be exactly what the user intended.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A full check of all validity constraints (hard &amp; soft) is offered by the Client Service as a separate endpoint. The separation between hard and soft validity constraints is implemented to provide the fastest possible execution of device filters.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Expression tree constraints<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>Mandatory root node (hard validity constraint): The expression tree must have a root node.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>No missing leaf nodes (hard validity constraint): The expression tree of a device filter must have at least one term beneath each logical operation node.<\/p><h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Constraints on filter terms<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Each device filter term type defines its own validity constraints.
