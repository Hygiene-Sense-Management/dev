hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM is designed to work consistently and comprehensible in different time-zones. To achieve this HsM usually stores date-time values as date-time-offsets. A date time offset represents a point in time - typically expressed as date and time of day, relative (but not in) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Therefore a date time offset includes a date time value together with an offset that defines the difference between the the current date time offset instance\'s date and time and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Notes\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_Notes\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note: <\/span><span class=\"f_Notes\">a date time offset does not have any information about the timezones it stores the offset from UTC that can be used to transform the date and time value to a unambiguous time instant on the global time line. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Example: The date time offset 2021-02-15 12:05:00+01:00 has a data part of 2021-02-15 a time part of &nbsp;12:05:00 and an offset to UTC of +01:00 i.e. this date time offset equals 2021-02-15 11:05:00+00:00.<\/p>\n\r"
