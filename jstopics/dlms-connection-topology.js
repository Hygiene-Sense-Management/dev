hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Data Link Monitoring Service monitors which non-gateway devices are connected to which gateways and keeps a historical record for this information.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Whenever the Data Link Monitoring Service receives information about a non-gateway device connected or disconnected from a stationary gateway it records this information together with a time stamp. The Data Link Monitoring Service therefore knows which devices are currently connected to each stationary gateway and which devices have been connected in the past. It also knows which stationary gateways a specific device is connected to currently and was connected to in the past.<\/p>\n\r"
