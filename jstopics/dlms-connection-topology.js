hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Data Link Monitoring Service monitors which BLE-networked devices are connected to which stationary gateways and keeps a historical record of this information.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Whenever the Data Link Monitoring Service receives information about a BLE-networked device connected or disconnected from a stationary gateway it records this information together with a time stamp. The Data Link Monitoring Service therefore knows which BLE-networked devices are currently connected to each stationary gateway and which BLE-networked devices have been connected in the past. It also knows which stationary gateways a specific BLE-networked device is connected to currently and was connected to in the past.<\/p>\n\r"
