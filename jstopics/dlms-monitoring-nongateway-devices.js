hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Stationary gateways actively monitor the Bluetooth communication links with non-gateway devices and report the status of these links to the Data Link Monitoring Service. The technical environment allows an immediate detection of newly established Bluetooth connections (within a few seconds) and lost device connections within about 10 seconds.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>Stationary gateways continuously monitor Bluetooth connections to BLE-networked devices and report changes to the connection status to the Data Link Monitoring Service immediately. Changes can be newly connected devices, or lost device connections. The information is sent as <a href=\"prdp-messagetype-device-gateway-connection-status.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Device-gateway connection status<\/a> message via Azure IoT Hub.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If a gateway looses its connection to Azure IoT Hub (e.g. due to a lost internet connection) it will cache status changes and will deliver the status changes for each device to the Data Link Monitoring Service via Azure IoT Hub on re-connection. Caching is limited to 48 h. The information is sent as <a href=\"prdp-messagetype-device-gateway-connection-status.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Device gateway link status<\/a> message via Azure IoT Hub. This behavior also applies during the start-up phase of the gateway: BLE connections to devices established before the gateway has connection to Azure Iot Hub will be cached and sent to the IoT Hub once the connection is established.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If a BLE-networked device devices looses connection to a stationary gateway while that gateway is offline and if then the gateway is rebooted (and therefore looses its cache) the status change to offline of that device will never reach the Data Link Monitoring Service. To recover from these (extremely rare) cases of devices falsely considered as online the stationary gateway sends all its connected devices once every 6 hours. The  Data Link Monitoring Service can therefore rely that it gets information about every connected device once every 6 hours. Devices that do not get an update for more than 6 h are therefore always considered as offline.<\/p>"
