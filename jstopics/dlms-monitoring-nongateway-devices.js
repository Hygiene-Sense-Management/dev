hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Stationary gateways actively monitor the Bluetooth communication links with non-gateway devices and report the status of these links to the Data Link Monitoring Service. The technical environment allows an immediate detection of newly established Bluetooth connections (within a few seconds) and lost device connections within about 10 seconds.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>After start up of a stationary gateway and after a grace period for establishing Bluetooth connection with nearby devices stationary gateways report all device links to the Data Link Monitoring Service.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>The stationary gateway continuously monitors Bluetooth connections to non-gateway devices and reports changes to the connection status to the Data Link Monitoring Service immediately. Changes can be newly connected devices, or lost device connections.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If the gateway looses internet connection (and therefore connection to the Data Link Monitoring Service) it will cache status changes and will deliver the status changes for each device to the Data Link Monitoring Service on re-connection. Caching is limited to 48 h.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If a non-gateway device looses connection to a gateway and that gateway is offline at this time and if then the gateway is rebooted (and therefore looses its cache) the status change to offline of that device will never reach the Data Link Monitoring Service. To prevent these (extremely rare) case of devices falsely considered as online the stationary gateway sends all its connected devices once every 4 hours. The  Data Link Monitoring Service can therefore rely that it gets information about every connected device once every 4 hours. Devices that do not get an update for more than 4 h are always considered as offline.<\/p>"
