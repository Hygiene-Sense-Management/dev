hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App continuously builds up connections to discovered HsM BLE-networked devices to read all resource instance values recorded by this device. This process is called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">browsing<\/span>.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Foreground browsing<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the Xibu App is in foreground (is the currently active app on the mobile device) browsing is performed when the app is on the device status screen. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App connects to discovered HsM BLE-networked devices sequentially (i.e. not in parallel but one device after the other). Each device will only be connected once every 15 minutes. I.e. the Xibu App will collect a full set of resource instance values only once every 15 minutes. The data broadcast by the non-gateway device via <a href=\"cuapp-ble-advertising.html\" class=\"topiclink\">advertising<\/a> is however collected and forwarded more frequently.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Background browsing with BLE Beacons.<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Even if the Xibu App is in background (is not the currently active app on the mobile device) it can still discover and browse devices by utilizing BLE Beacons. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Mobile devices (smart phones) can detect when they enter or exit a particular setting by monitoring BLE beacons. BLE beacons are specially structured BLE packets sent by BLE devices. The operating systems of these mobile devices have an internal logic that decides whether it enters the area of the beacon source (the device sending the beacon packet) or leaves the area of the beacon source. Both events can then trigger actions on the mobile device.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM BLE-networked devices send BLE beacon packets (iBeacons) regularly, thus Mobile devices can detect if they enter the area of a HsM device or leave the area of a HsM device. The Xibu App registers with the operating system of the mobile device so that it is woken up whenever the operating system enters the area of BLE devices that send beacons with specific beacon ids. The Xibu App will then discover and browse devices in it\'s vicinity. This way the Xibu App can discover and browse HsM devices even when in background.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">As described above operating systems of mobile devices will only trigger actions when the enter or leave a setting. However the Xibu App shall also be woken up regularly when the mobile device is nearby HsM non-gateway devices for a longer time. Therefore HsM non-gateway devices send BLE beacons with changing beacon ids.<\/p>\n\r"
