hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">This Reference Manual covers all aspects of HsM. It includes information for the occasional system user, power users, administrators but also for third party developers and decision makers. It is not intended to be a step-by-step guide that shows you how to solve a particular sensor data management problem, but gives you the knowledge that enables you to use HsM in a way that fits best to your requirements. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This Reference Manual does not require any prior knowledge of HsM but a good general understanding of IT systems is surely necessary.<\/p>\n\r"
