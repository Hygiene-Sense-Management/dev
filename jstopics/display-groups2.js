A resource instances of a firmware variant version can be linked to one composition position within a one composition, but can be linked to any number of composition positions as long as these positions belong to different resource compositions.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Example:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A resource composition named <span class=\"f_Identifier\">The Main 3<\/span> could be used to define a structure that holds the main three resource instances of firmware variant versions within specific device types. This resource composition would define three positions named 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Now within a firmware variant version one resource instance can be mapped to the element 1st, one to element 2nd one to element 3rd.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A client software may now use this information to render the 3 most important resource instance for a specific firmware variant version.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Example 2:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A resource composition named “Fill state” may be used to define the resource instance that matches the meaning “Fill state” across different firmware variant versions. This resource composition would only have one element named Fill state. Within each firmware variant version one (and only one) resource instance can now be mapped to the fill stat element.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Client software can now use this information to render the fill state for different device types.<\/p>\n\r"
