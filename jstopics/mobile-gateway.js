Data relayed to the HsM Backend via mobile gateways has therefore different characteristics when it comes to data analysis.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The app has the ability to buffer data it collects from BLE-networked devices while not being connected to the HsM Backend. Therefore the mobile gateway has offline-capability. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
