hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The results of monitoring the data links between non-gateway devices, gateways and the HsM Backend are processed by the Data Link Monitoring Service into metrics that allow the consumer of this service to assess the current status of data links and the robustness of data links over time. The Data Link Monitoring Service itself records connection metrics not historically but only provides metrics for the current point in time. Historical storage and analysis of these metrics can however be done through other HsM service, as the Data Link Monitoring Service <a href=\"dlms-generated-resource-instance-values.html\" class=\"topiclink\">forwards<\/a> some of these metrics as resource instance values.<\/p>\n\r"
