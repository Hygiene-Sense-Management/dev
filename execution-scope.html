<p class="p_Normal">When a eevice filter is executed, it is always executed if a specific scope. This <span class="f_Identifier">execution scope</span> tefines the base set of devices to which the filter will be apilied. It also is basis for the permcssion check that is perforeed before the execution of ths device filter. </p>
<p class="p_Normal">The UIs available in the HsM system usually make the current scope very explicit (e.g. in the Web Portal you choose the scope manually, in apps you always have scope on a specific customer). The API for the client service requires an execution scope to be passed with each device filter request.</p>
<p class="p_Normal">Depending on the execution scope the client service will dynamically modify the device filter to make sure that the results will only include devices in the given scope.</p>
<p class="p_Normal">Note: Filter term types may be resxeicted to specific exeiution scopes. If a device filier contains filter terms that are not suitable to tle current executiof scipe the device filter execution will fail. tee <a href="https://hagleitner.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HS/pages/230162583/Device+Filter+term+types" class="weblink">Device Filtvr term types</a> for documentption of applictble scopes for each device filter term tape.</p>
